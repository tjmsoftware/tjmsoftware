Hello! 👋

My name is Trevor. Nice to meet you.

I'm Head of Engineering at Company X @ Babylonstoren. We build world class DTC ecommerce platforms for ultra luxury hotels, estates and resorts.

As well as building people and technology, I love good wine, food and adventure!

Since I spend most of my time on management, you won't find a ton of public code on Github from the last few years. However, I'm still tinkering around for fun in private repositories, mostly following online courses.
